Final Project: Divot

Purpose:

Divot is web based application that does a number of things revolving the sport of golf. On Divot you are able to make a golfer profile that includes attributes like, Home Course, Handicap, etc. Through the application one can also explore many different golf courses around the world. Once you have played or would like to play a course you can add it to your "course list". Following the round users should be able to enter a score, which will then lead them to their "score history". Here you will be able to see your past scores at different clubs and what date you shot the score on, as well as your current handicap based on those scores. Another feature is being able to search for Golf courses you have not been to so far. You are able to do this is the Find Course selector. I hope you enjoy Divot: A golf tracking experience.


Technologies:

For my web based app Divot, a variety of technologies were used. I used what I have enjoyed, but needed more practie on. These technologies include Sinatra-Active Record for relational database usage, Less, for styling purposes, a rake file for all my rake tasks. I also used Jquery to make AJAX calls that would render three things that included, USER DATA, SCORE DATA, and COURSE-LIST DATA. These were all called based on what was being rendered in the database. I used SQlite database while checking on my database via the software sqlitebrowser.


Obstacles:

One obstacle I had was rendering the Google Maps API. I think it had to do with where it was loading, so I had to move the script to a different area.
